# 🕌 Prayer Times Backend

A .NET backend service that provides **Islamic prayer times** for cities worldwide.  
It fetches accurate times from the [Aladhan API](https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api), stores them in a database, and makes them available via REST API.  
Additionally, it integrates with **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** to send notifications before prayer times.

## ✨ Features
- Fetch daily and monthly prayer times from Aladhan API.
- REST API endpoints for cities and countries.
- Scheduled jobs to clean up old records.
- Firebase integration for push notifications.
- Database persistence with **Entity Framework Core**.
